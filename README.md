- **Forward Reasoning**: This program applies _modus ponens_ or forward reasoning given a set of rules and facts. It can also show the completeness of the reasoning.

- **Graphical Separation**: This program applies a graphical separation algorithm to a bayesian network given two of its variables and decides whether they are graphical independent or not.

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: This program applies Chow-Liu's algorithm to a bayesian network.

- **Variable Elimination**: This program applies variable eliminination (VE) algorithm to a bayesian network. It works for both marginal and conditional inference.
